## Why create this?

This app was created for a class at Prime Digital Academy.

The objective was to create a clone of a popular social media platform. This was an excersize to learn html and css but javascript was allowed.

I chose Tik Tok because it has a simple user interface and I thought I could make something interesting within the 2 week time constraint.

## How does it work?

This app is a psudo clone of https://tiktok.com. It is called TOk ToK and is a fake social media site to display single words.

Every peice of content you see on the page is generated with a random background color, a random profile, and random text, using the API's mentioned above.

As you scroll the site will continue to call the API's and generate new content for you to look at.

Many of the buttons do nothing however, you can follow accounts with the red follow button on the post and then visit those posts later by clicking on account name on the left side. You can also search for posts that you enjoyed with the search bar.

You can also like posts but keep in mind the like count is randomly generated so you make no impact what so ever.
