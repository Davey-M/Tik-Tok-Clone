## Check out the site here

## Why create this?

This app was created for a class at Prime Digital Academy.

The objective was to create a clone of a popular social media platform. This was an excersize to learn html and css but javascript was allowed.

I chose Tik Tok because it has a simple user interface and I thought I could make something interesting within the 2 week time constraint.

## How does it work?

This app is a psudo clone of https://tiktok.com. It is called TOk ToK and is a fake social media site to display single words.

Every peice of content you see on the page is generated with a random background color, a random profile, and random text, using the API's mentioned above.

As you scroll the site will continue to call the API's and generate new content for you to look at.

Many of the buttons do nothing however, you can follow accounts with the red follow button on the post and then visit those posts later by clicking on account name on the left side.

You can also like posts but keep in mind the like count is randomly generated so you make no impact what so ever.

## Viewing the page

There are two ways to view the page on your machine:

### 1.

-   Clone the github repository to your local machine.
    -   there is a tutorial here if needed https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository.
-   Open the index.html file inside the public folder.
-   This way works just fine but you may miss out on features that require a database.

### 2.

-   Clone the github repository just like step 1.
-   make sure you have node.js installed on your machine. If not you can find it here https://nodejs.org/en/.
-   Navigate to the repository folder on your local machine with the terminal.
-   Run the command ```node .```
-   This will start a server on localhost:3000.
-   Open a browser window and go to "localhost:3000".
-   Now you have full access to an instance of the site running on your local machine.

> ## Important Note
>
> Method #2 for running the program is not recommended as there is no database.
> A database may be created in the future.
